# archlinux
I have been working on several projects lately to help with the simplification of numerous tasks pertaining to Arch Linux. While many like using commands, there are users who seek alternative ways to install packages and keep their system up to date. This project will contain many scripts that are user friendly. Any questions pertaining to this repository can best be answered by me, WL7BH via Internet Relay Chat (irc.alaskanet.us) channel #linux ... I am on most of the time so don't hesitate to come on and ask questions!

73 and God Bless,
